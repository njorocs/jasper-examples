# JasperReports example

## Project on how to generate PDF report using JasperReports library

This project is based on **Spring Boot** and **Maven**. All the necessary resources (database and jasper reports) are included. To play with this project you just need to clone it, call the maven wrapper and (if everything goes fine) open the PDF generated report.

### How to run this project

If you just want to run this example, you don't need any IDE (Eclipse/Netbeans/IntelliJ). Assuming you are running Linux, you just need these lines:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/sergiodurand/jasper-examples.git
$ cd jasper-examples
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
$ xdg-open /tmp/report.pdf
```
